# Disaster Management System
Qualified into the Round 2 of Codeshastra, we created a relief system for disaster affected people.

It used an E-commerce platform for a donation collection system and tracked the geo-location of people and sending notifications to them for distater prone areas. Backend used Django and REST APIs. The E-Commerce framework was built using a Django-Oscar.

## Tech Stack
- **Django Backend**
- **HTML, CSS and Bootstrap**
- **REST API communicating with an Android Application**
- **Google Places API**
- **Donations implemented using Django Oscar**
